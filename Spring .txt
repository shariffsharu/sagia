Spring framework

1: A spring container inside this we have as many objects as we want and those objects will 
be managed by spring container 
2: Advantages of having objects in spring container is we will see 
3: the life cycle of a object will be handled by spring container 
4: The above points We are discussing and you have to remember the xml file of spring 
5: 

Factory pattern: 
Oject factory will create the objects and it will product the objects 

Object factory will read the configuration file and create the new object and handled to the 
other objects 

here the configuration is XML File 

Spring has Spring bean factory 

The bean factory will read from spring XML (configuration file) 
and the spring bean is created 

Bean Factory --> Bean (beanid) --> Class (service providing class) --> object will be returned 

Now we will code the whole stuff 

Still we have not discussed the dependency injustion but this will be the basic for us
